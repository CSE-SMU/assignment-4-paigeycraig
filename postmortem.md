# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Paige Craig


## How difficult was this assignment?
It wasn't too difficult, however, I found that the hardest part was teaching oursevles how to do it through the examples online. It was hard to make sure I wasn't just copying the code but actually going through and understanding what I was doing, etc. 



## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
Yes, I had never worked with Angular JS before so it was an entirely different experience for me.



## How could this assignment be improved?
It was a good assignment, I want to understand more about Angular JS because it seems very useful.



## Any other comments?
This is actually a cool app to have knowledge of how to create. Might use it in the future!!
